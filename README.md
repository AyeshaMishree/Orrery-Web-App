## 1. Introduction & Background

The study of celestial bodies and their movements has fascinated humanity for centuries. With advancements in technology, we now have the ability to visualize and understand the behavior of solar system objects in an interactive and dynamic way.

This project focuses on building a **web application** that delivers a detailed, real-time visualization of the **solar system and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)**. Through this platform, users can explore the dynamic nature of planetary motion, asteroid trajectories, and comet paths in an educational and immersive format.

## 2. Key Features

- **🌍 Real-time Visualization:** A dynamic orrery model that displays planetary movements and NEO data with live updates.
- **🪐 Interactive Interface:** Zoom, pan, and focus on celestial bodies such as planets and asteroids.
- **🔐 User Authentication:** Secure login and account features using Firebase Authentication.
- **📡 Real-time Data:** Integrated with external APIs for the latest celestial information.
- **🖥️ User-Friendly UI:** Clean and intuitive design for effortless exploration.

## 3. Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Real-time astronomical data fetched via external APIs.
- **Frontend Development:** Interactive orrery built using **Flutter**, displaying live planetary and NEO movement.
- **Backend Development:** API integration and logic handled with **Node.js**.
- **Authentication:** Secured using **Firebase Authentication**.
- **Deployment:** Containerized and deployed using **Docker** on cloud infrastructure.
- **Testing:** Optimized for smooth performance across various browsers and devices.

## 4. Technologies Used

- **Flutter** – UI and frontend logic for rendering the interactive model
- **Firebase** – Authentication and real-time database services
- **Node.js** – Backend logic and external API integration
- **JavaScript** – Server-side scripting and request handling
- **Firestore** – Database for storing live NEO and planetary data
